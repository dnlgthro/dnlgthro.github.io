            <p>For this portfolio, I chose to use minimal design. I decided to do this for two reasons: Firstly, a simple design will allow users of the site more ease of use. Secondly, a simple design is within my HTML and CSS capabilities. In lieu of a border, I attempted to make use of negative space to guide the reader's eye towards the main content of the page. This look remains consistent throughout the site's three pages. When designing this page, I also attempted to keep the Gestalt principles in mind and to make sure content sections were consistently spaced and separated enough to remain distinct.</p>
            
            <p>Color was used as an organizational tool throughout the site. Navgation on the site is contrasted with the background so as to make it obvious for users. The navigation buttons also change colour when a mouse hovers over them to indicate which option is being selected (this could be beneficial to users who are visually impaired). Contrasting colours were also used to indicate headings within the pages. You can notice that all headings are coloured red so as to separate them from the paragraphs. In order to ensure contrasting but complimentary colurs, I consulted <a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, I used the meta tag for keywords to aid in this site being indexed by Google and retrieved in search results. In addition to meta tags, I made use of div tags when desgining the hierarchy of the site. An unordered list was used to create the navigation, while an ordered list was used for lists on the Home and Further Reading pages. CSS elements wereused to style the site, and they ranged from margins and padding to clearing a float and display blocks. CSS was also used to ensure the site is resppnsive, for example the sidebar will disappear when the screen resolution reaches a certain size so as to make viewing easier. For a more extensive look at the HTML and CSS, I recommend using Google Chrome's View Source and Developer Tools features.  </p>
