 -            <p> That day the Yellow Emperor showed his palace to the poet<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Little by little, step by
 -                step, they left behind, in long procession, the first westward-facing terraces
 -                which, like the jagged hemicycles of an almost unbounded amphitheater, stepped down
 -                into a paradise, a garden whose metal mirrors and intertwined hedges of juniper were
 -                a prefiguration of the labyrinth. Cheerfully they lost themselves in it—at first as
 -                though condescending to a game, but then not without some uneasiness, because its
 -                straight allées suffered from a very gentle but continuous curvature, so that
 -                secretly the avenues were circles. Around midnight, observation of the planets and
 -                the opportune sacrifice of a tortoise allowed them to escape the bonds of that
 -                region that seemed enchanted, though not to free themselves from that sense of being
 -                lost that accompanied them to the end. They wandered next through antechambers and
 -                courtyards and libraries, and then through a hexagonal room with a water clock, and
 -                one morning, from a tower, they made out a man of stone, whom later they lost sight
 -                of forever. </p>

 -            <p> In canoes hewn from sandalwood, they crossed many gleaming rivers—or perhaps a
 -                single river many times. The imperial entourage would pass and people would fall to
 -                their knees and bow their heads to the ground, but one day the courtiers came to an
 -                island where one man did not do this, for he had never seen the Celestial Son
 -                before, and the executioner had to decapitate him. The eyes of the emperor and poet
 -                looked with indifference on black tresses and black dances and golden masks; the
 -                real merged and mingled with the dreamed—or the real, rather, was one of the shapes
 -                the dream took. It seemed impossible that the earth should be anything but gardens,
 -                fountains, architectures, and forms of splendour. </p>
 -            <p> Every hundred steps a tower cut the air; to the eye, their colour was identical, but
 -                the first of them was yellow and the last was scarlet; that was how delicate the
 -                gradations were and how long the series. It was at the foot of the penultimate tower
 -                that the poet (who had appeared untouched by the spectacles which all the others had
 -                so greatly marvelled at) recited the brief composition that we link indissolubly to
 -                his name today, the words which, as the most elegant historians never cease
 -                repeating, garnered the poet immortality and death. The text has been lost; there
 -                are those who believe that it consisted of but a single line; others, of a single
 -                word. What we do know—however incredible it may be—is that within the poem lay the
 -                entire enormous palace, whole and to the least detail, with every venerable
 -                porcelain it contained and every scene on every porcelain, all the lights and
 -                shadows of its twilights, and every forlorn or happy moment of the glorious
 -                dynasties of mortals, gods, and dragons that had lived within it through all its
 -                endless past. </p>
 -            <p> Everyone fell silent; then the emperor spoke. <q>You have stolen my palace!</q> he cried,
 -                and the executioner’s iron scythe mowed down the poet’s life. </p>
 -            <p> Others tell the story differently. The world cannot contain two things that are
 -                identical; no sooner, they say, had the poet uttered his poem than the palace
 -                disappeared, as though in a puff of smoke, wiped from the face of the earth by the
 -                final syllable. Such legends, of course, are simply literary fictions. The poet was
 -                the emperor’s slave and died a slave; his composition fell into oblivion because it
 -                merited oblivion, and his descendants still seek, though they shall never find, the
 -                word for the universe. </p>
