                <h2><cite>Space Time Continuum</cite>, Aaron Diehl (Mack Avenue)</h2>
                <p>**** four stars</p>
                <p>At only 29, pianist Aaron Diehl already exhibits a wisdom and mastery of the
                    piano some cats don’t achieve until they are well into middle age. On
                        <cite>Space Time Continuum</cite>, he sidesteps any kind of psychedelic or
                    electric clichés associated with the relationship between jazz music and outer
                    space by delivering this beguiling set of good old-fashioned post-bop with the
                    help of his invincible rhythm section of bassist David Wong and drummer Quincy
                    Davis and such famous pals as saxophonist Benny Golson and baritone sax icon Joe
                    Temperley. Jazz this connected to the stars never sounded so earthbound. </p>

                <h2><cite>Hommage à Eberhard Weber</cite>, Pat Metheny, Jan Garbarek, Gary Burton,
                    Scott Coley, Danny Gottlieb, Paul McCandless and the SWR Big Band (ECM)</h2>
                <p>***** five stars</p>
                <p>2015 saw guitarist Pat Metheny returning home to the label where he got his
                    auspicious start for the first time since the release of his 1984 LP <cite>Full
                        Circle</cite> to celebrate the 75th anniversary of his former bassist
                    Eberhard Weber. This mind-blowing live album draws from the two-night-long Great
                    Jubilee Concert in Weber’s hometown of Stuttgart, Germany, this past January
                    celebrating the life and career of a true architect of the ECM sound.</p>
